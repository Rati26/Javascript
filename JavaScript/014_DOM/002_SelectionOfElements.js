// DOM tree refers to the HTML page where all the nodes are objects. There can be three main types of nodes in the DOM tree :
// text nodes  
// element nodes 
// comment nodes

// In an HTML page the <body> and <head> are the children of <html>
// a text node is always the leaf of the tree.

// Auto Correction
// If an errorneous HTML is encountered by the browser,it tends to correct it. For example if we put something after the body, it is automatically moved inside the body. Another example is <table> tag which must contain <tbody>  

// Walking the DOM
document.documentElement //HTML tag
document.body //Body tag
document.head //Head tag
document.title // Will return the string
